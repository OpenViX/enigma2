This document explains the changes and updates to the VirtualKeyBoard of 
Enigma2.  The code is located in:
	/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Screens/VirtualKeyBoard.py

The revised virtual keyboard is dynamically created based on the data 
defined in the "self.locales" data in the "__init__" method of the 
"VirtualKeyBoard" class.  To make creating new locales based on common 
languages easier a number of base language definitions are provided. 
(Currently English, French, German, Russian, Scandinavian and Spanish.) 
The locales are based on the list at https://lh.2xlibre.net/locales/.

* The maximum width of the keyboard has been set at 14 buttons.  This 
limitation is set by the skin allocation of space for the keyboard and then 
confirmed in this code in the "virtualKeyBoardEntryComponent" method.  If 
the "keyList" data describes a keyboard less than 14 characters then that 
keyboard will be centred in the 14 wide keyboard space.  The button layouts 
for each of the keyboards is based on the layouts at http://kbdlayout.info/.

Each element of the "keyList" data is a button displayed on the virtual 
keyboard.  Certain button names are mapped to images that will be used 
for that button.  The current image button definitions are listed in 
the "self.keyImages" dictionary in the "__init__" method of the 
"VirtualKeyBoard" class. To make future updates easier all non English 
characters are represented by their unicode numeric code 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters).

* Any sequence of identical button definitions on any single row of a 
"keyList" entry will be used to generate a single wide button on the 
screen occupying all the defined positions.

* This revision also allows the four colour buttons to be assigned to any 
keyboard key by nominating the key text in the "self.keyHiglights" 
dictionary in the "__init__" method of the "VirtualKeyBoard" class. 
This change will allow for colour button text to be localised rather than 
depending on a graphical button to achieve the coloured border.  Note that 
the ENTER and SHIFT button graphics should default to the GREEN and BLUE 
borders, respectively, but can now be changed.

This revision also adds the ability to define the foreground colours of the 
characters on the virtual keyboard.  The colour selections for the unshifted 
and three predefined shift levels are defined as white, white, cyan and 
magenta respectively.  These colours match the default SHIFT button 
images.  These colours can be overridden by a skin author via the 
"VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" skin parameter.  (The number of shift levels 
can be increased if required.)

* The updated virtual keyboard has a new and optional calling parameter 
"style=".  This calling parameter can be used to adjust the text of the 
GREEN button and the optional text on the keypad button for the "Enter" 
key.  The values that can be used are:
	VKB_DONE_GRAPHIC
	VKB_ENTER_GRAPHIC
	VKB_OK_GRAPHIC
	VKB_SAVE_GRAPHIC
	VKB_DONE_TEXT
	VKB_ENTER_TEXT
	VKB_OK_TEXT
	VKB_SAVE_TEXT
The first four options change the GREEN button text to "Done", "Enter", 
"OK" and "Save" respectively but keep the keypad grid image of the 
"ENTER" button.  The next four options change both the GREEN button and 
the text used on the keypad grid.

* This revision includes two optional new parameters to give skin designers 
more control of the VirtualKeyBoard display:

* The "VirtualKeyBoardAlignment" parameter takes two comma separated 
decimal values.  The first value specifies the horizontal alignment of the 
data in each of the keyboard keymap cells.  The second value specifies the 
vertical alignment of the data in each of the keyboard keymap cells.

* The horizontal "VirtualKeyBoardAlignment" values are:
	0 - Auto - Default  (Auto=Left on left button, Centre on middle 
				buttons, Right on right button).
	1 - Left
	2 - Centre
	3 - Right

* The vertical "VirtualKeyBoardAlignment" values are:
	0 - Auto - Default  (Auto=Centre)
	1 - Top
	2 - Centre
	3 - Bottom

* The "VirtualKeyBoardPadding" parameter takes two comma separated 
decimal values.  The first value specifies the horizontal (left and right) 
padding of the data in each of the keyboard keymap cells.  The second 
value specifies the vertical (top and bottom) padding of the data in each 
of the keyboard keymap cells.  This parameter controls how close the content 
of a cell can come to the edges of that cell.  The default is 4 pixels for 
720 skins and 7 pixels for 1080 skins.  These values allows the content of 
the cell to stay clear of the default highlighting and current cell overlay 
indicators.

* To further assist with changing the skin of the Virtual KeyBoard the 
various colour highlights and button images no longer contain any part of 
the virtual keyboard background image.  They are now standalone images on 
a transparent background.  These images are now placed on top of the 
background cell image rather than replacing it.  These images now blend 
in with *any* selected image chosen for the cell background.  For most 
skinning changes to the cell background the skin designer now only needs 
to replace the three component images that constitute the cell background. 
(NOTE: If a light background is desired then many of the images will need 
to be changed to a contrasting colour so as to be seen.)

This revision also improves font size options.  The previous 
"VirtualKeyBoard" skin font parameter is retained but a new scaling option 
has been added to the code such that short text messages can be now assigned 
to keyboard buttons.  For example, text like ".com", ".org" etc to make 
Internet address entry easier.  To ensure that longer key text can fit in 
the screen space available any text longer than one character will be drawn 
at 56% of the "VirtualKeyBoard" skin font parameter assigned font size.

This revision also adds HELP button text to assist users with using the 
updated Virtual KeyBoard interface.

If the VirtualKeyBoard interface is to be re-skinned then the following
"name=" screen widgets should be defined:
	prompt   - This widget displays the prompt text for the entry.
	text     - This widget displays the current text buffer.
	list     - This widget displays the keyboard grid.
	locale   - This widget displays the currently selected keyboard
		   language.
	language - This widget displays the current language.

The standard colour and action buttons "source=" screen widgets can also 
be defined:
	key_red    - This widget displays the RED button exit text prompt.
	key_green  - This widget displays the GREEN button save text prompt.
	key_yellow - This widget displays the YELLOW button locale menu
		     prompt.
	key_blue   - This widget displays the BLUE button shift text prompt.
	key_info   - This widget triggers the INFO button.
	key_help   - This widget triggers the HELP button.

	(See /doc/BUTTONGUIDE in the repository for more information.)

For example in a 1280 x 720 skin:
	<fonts>
		<font name="DejaVuSans" filename="DejaVuSans.ttf" scale="100" />
		<alias name="VirtualKeyBoard" font="DejaVuSans" size="28" height="45" />
	</fonts>

	<parameters>
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardAlignment" value="0,0" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoard" value="45,45" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardPadding" value="4,4" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="16777215,16777215,65535,16711935" />
	</parameters>

	<screen name="VirtualKeyBoard" title="Virtual Keyboard" position="center,center" size="660,375" zPosition="99">
		<widget name="prompt" position="15,10" size="630,25" font="Regular;20" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<ePixmap pixmap="buttons/vkey_text.png" position="10,35" size="640,50" alphatest="blend" zPosition="-4" />
		<widget name="text" position="15,35" size="630,46" font="Regular;40" halign="right" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="list" position="15,100" size="630,225" backgroundColor="#001c2c5c" foregroundColor="window-fg" selectionDisabled="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="locale" position="15,340" size="570,25" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="mode" position="585,340" size="60,25" font="Regular;20" halign="right" transparent="1" valign="center" />
		<widget name="language" position="0,0" size="0,0" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
	</screen>

	WARNING: Due to limitations in the parameter parsing the shift 
	colours MUST be specified as decimal numbers for all firmware 
	versions earlier than 4-Sep-2018.  For firmware builds later than 
	4-Sep-2018 the colours can be specified as decimal numbers, hex 
	numbers, Enigma2 "#" colour codes or colour names.  For example, 
	the following parameters are equaly valid and effectively the same:
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="16777215,16777215,65535,16711935" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="0x00ffffff,0x00ffffff,0x0000ffff,0x00ff00ff" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="#00ffffff,#00ffffff,#0000ffff,#00ff00ff" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="White,White,Cyan,Magenta" />
		(Assuming the colours "White", "Cyan" and "Magenta" are defined!)

	IMPORTANT: Make sure that all the 720 "vkey_*" images are copied to 
	the "/usr/share/enigma2/<skin>/buttons/" directory where "<skin>" is 
	the name of the skin that you are updating.

For example in a 1920 x 1080 skin:
	<fonts>
		<font name="DejaVuSans" filename="DejaVuSans.ttf" scale="100" />
		<alias name="VirtualKeyBoard" font="DejaVuSans" size="42" height="68" />
	</fonts>

	<parameters>
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardAlignment" value="0,0" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoard" value="68,68" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardPadding" value="7,7" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="16777215,16777215,65535,16711935" />
	</parameters>

	<screen name="VirtualKeyBoard" title="Virtual Keyboard" position="center,center" size="980,495" zPosition="99">
		<widget name="prompt" position="14,10" size="952,25" font="Regular;20" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<ePixmap pixmap="buttons/vkey_text.png" position="10,45" size="960,50" alphatest="blend" zPosition="-4" />
		<widget name="text" position="14,48" size="952,46" font="Regular;40" halign="right" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="list" position="14,105" size="952,340" backgroundColor="#001c2c5c" foregroundColor="window-fg" selectionDisabled="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="locale" position="14,460" size="800,25" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="mode" position="892,460" size="60,25" font="Regular;20" halign="right" transparent="1" valign="center" />
		<widget name="language" position="0,0" size="0,0" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
	</screen>

	colours MUST be specified as decimal numbers for all firmware 
	versions earlier than 4-Sep-2018.  For firmware builds later than

		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="White,White,Cyan,Magenta" />
		(Assuming the colours "White", "Cyan" and "Magenta" are defined!)

	IMPORTANT: Make sure that all the 1080 "vkey_*" images are copied to 
	the "/usr/share/enigma2/<skin>/buttons/" directory where "<skin>" is 
	the name of the skin that you are updating.

NOTE:
	The most important changes for a skin is to ensure that the width of 
	the "list" object is wide enough to display the larger keyboard.  The 
	width is calculated by multiplying number of buttons (14) by the 
	width of each button (in parameter "VirtualKeyBoard" and the actual 
	width of the button background or image. (720 skins 14 x 45 = 630, 
	1080 skins 14 x 68 = 952) 

	Also, the enhanced VirtualKeyBoard adds some new button images and 
	abandons others.  Graphic buttons for plain text are deprecated as 
	the new code creates these on the fly while allowing for language 
	localisation.

Removing legacy VirtualKeyBoard support:
	If support for the old VirtualKeyBoard code is not required for a 
	skin then the following items may be removed / deleted from the 
	skin:

	From the <fonts> block in the skin remove:
		<alias name="VirtualKeyboard" ... />
	
	From the <parameters> block in the skin remove:
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyboard" ... />

	IMPORTANT: The lower case "b" in "board" is significant!  The 
	"VirtualKeyboard" entries are used by the old code while 
	"VirtualKeyBoard" entries are used by the new code.

	* From the buttons directory in the skin delete:
		vkey_all.png
		vkey_blue.png
		vkey_clr.png
		vkey_esc.png
		vkey_green.png
		vkey_ok.png
		vkey_red.png
		vkey_sel.png
		vkey_shift.png
		vkey_shift_sel.png
		vkey_yellow.png
	Please do not delete any of these images if they are shared by other 
	skins that continue to support the older VirtualKeyBoard code.
	
	* NOTE: The image "vkey_bg.png" is no longer used by the new 
	VirtualKeyBoard but must not be removed as it is used by 
	"NTIVirtualKeyBoard.pyo"!  When this tool is removed from the 
	base build the old image can be removed.
