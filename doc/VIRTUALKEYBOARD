This document explains the changes and updates to the VirtualKeyBoard of 
Enigma2.  The code is located in:
	/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Screens/VirtualKeyBoard.py

The revised virtual keyboard is dynamically created based on the data 
defined in the "self.locales" data in the "__init__" method of the 
"VirtualKeyBoard" class.  To make creating new locales based on common 
languages easier a number of base language definitions are provided. 
(Currently English, French, German, Russian, Scandinavian and Spanish.) 
The locales are based on the list at https://lh.2xlibre.net/locales/.

The maximum width of the keyboard has been set at 14 buttons.  This 
limitation is set by the skin allocation of space for the keyboard and then 
confirmed in this code in the "virtualKeyBoardEntryComponent" method.  If 
the "keyList" data describes a keyboard less than 14 characters then that 
keyboard will be centred in the 14 wide keyboard space.

Each element of the "keyList" data is a button displayed on the virtual 
keyboard.  Certain button names are mapped to images that will be used 
for that button.  The current image button definitions are listed in 
the "self.keyImages" dictionary in the "__init__" method of the 
"VirtualKeyBoard" class. To make future updates easier all non English 
characters are represented by their unicode numeric code 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters).

This revision also allows the four colour buttons to be assigned to any 
keyboard key by nominating the key text in the "self.keyBackgrounds" 
dictionary in the "__init__" method of the "VirtualKeyBoard" class. 
This change will allow for colour button text to be localised rather than 
depending on a graphical button to achieve the coloured border.  Note that 
the ENTER and SHIFT button graphics include the default GREEN and BLUE 
borders, respectively, as a default.

This revision also adds the ability to define the foreground colours of the 
characters on the virtual keyboard.  The colour selections for the unshifted 
and three predefined shift levels are defined as white, white, cyan and 
magenta respectively.  These colours match the default SHIFT button 
images.  These colours can be overridden by a skin author via the 
"VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" skin parameter.  (The number of shift levels 
can be increased if required.)

This revision also improves font size options.  The previous 
"VirtualKeyBoard" skin font parameter is retained but a new scaling option 
has been added to the code such that short text messages can be now assigned 
to keyboard buttons.  For example, for the en_AU implementation spare keys 
have been assigned to text like ".com", ".org" etc to make Internet address 
entry easier.  To ensure that longer key text can fit in the screen space 
available any text longer than one character will be drawn at 56% of the 
"VirtualKeyBoard" skin font parameter assigned font size.

This revision also adds HELP button text to assist users with using the 
updated Virtual KeyBoard interface.

If the VirtualKeyBoard interface is to be re-skinned then the following
"name=" screen widgets should be defined:
	prompt   - This widget displays the prompt text for the entry.
	text     - This widget displays the current text buffer.
	list     - This widget displays the keyboard grid.
	locale   - This widget displays the currently selected keyboard
		   language.
	language - This widget displays the current language.

The standard colour and action buttons "source=" screen widgets can also 
be defined:
	key_red    - This widget displays the RED button exit text prompt.
	key_green  - This widget displays the GREEN button save text prompt.
	key_yellow - This widget displays the YELLOW button locale menu
		     prompt.
	key_blue   - This widget displays the BLUE button shift text prompt.
	key_info   - This widget triggers the INFO button.
	key_help   - This widget triggers the HELP button.

	(See /doc/BUTTONGUIDE in the repository for more information.)

For example in a 1280 x 720 skin:
	<fonts>
		<font name="DejaVuSans" filename="DejaVuSans.ttf" scale="100" />
		<alias name="VirtualKeyBoard" font="DejaVuSans" size="28" height="45" />
	</fonts>

	<parameters>
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoard" value="45,45" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="16777215,16777215,65535,16711935" />
	</parameters>

	<screen name="VirtualKeyBoard" title="Virtual Keyboard" position="center,center" size="660,375" zPosition="99">
		<widget name="prompt" position="15,10" size="630,25" font="Regular;20" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<ePixmap pixmap="buttons/vkey_text.png" position="10,35" size="640,50" alphatest="blend" zPosition="-4" />
		<widget name="text" position="15,35" size="630,46" font="Regular;40" halign="right" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="list" position="15,100" size="630,225" backgroundColor="#001c2c5c" foregroundColor="window-fg" selectionDisabled="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="locale" position="15,340" size="570,25" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="mode" position="585,340" size="60,25" font="Regular;20" halign="right" transparent="1" valign="center" />
		<widget name="language" position="0,0" size="0,0" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
	</screen>

	WARNING: Due to limitations in the parameter parsing the shift 
	colours MUST be specified as decimal numbers for all firmware 
	versions earlier than 4-Sep-2018.  For firmware builds later than 
	4-Sep-2018 the colours can be specified as decimal numbers, hex 
	numbers, Enigma2 "#" colour codes or colour names.  For example, 
	the following parameters are equaly valid and effectively the same:
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="16777215,16777215,65535,16711935" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="0x00ffffff,0x00ffffff,0x0000ffff,0x00ff00ff" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="#00ffffff,#00ffffff,#0000ffff,#00ff00ff" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="White,White,Cyan,Magenta" />
		(Assuming the colours "White", "Cyan" and "Magenta" are defined!)

	IMPORTANT: Make sure that all the 720 "vkey_*" images are copied to 
	the "/usr/share/enigma2/<skin>/buttons/" directory where "<skin>" is 
	the name of the skin that you are updating.

For example in a 1920 x 1080 skin:
	<fonts>
		<font name="DejaVuSans" filename="DejaVuSans.ttf" scale="100" />
		<alias name="VirtualKeyBoard" font="DejaVuSans" size="42" height="68" />
	</fonts>

	<parameters>
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoard" value="68,68" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="16777215,16777215,65535,16711935" />
	</parameters>

	<screen name="VirtualKeyBoard" title="Virtual Keyboard" position="center,center" size="980,495" zPosition="99">
		<widget name="prompt" position="14,10" size="952,25" font="Regular;20" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<ePixmap pixmap="buttons/vkey_text.png" position="10,45" size="960,50" alphatest="blend" zPosition="-4" />
		<widget name="text" position="14,48" size="952,46" font="Regular;40" halign="right" noWrap="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="list" position="14,105" size="952,340" backgroundColor="#001c2c5c" foregroundColor="window-fg" selectionDisabled="1" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="locale" position="14,460" size="800,25" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
		<widget name="mode" position="892,460" size="60,25" font="Regular;20" halign="right" transparent="1" valign="center" />
		<widget name="language" position="0,0" size="0,0" font="Regular;20" transparent="1" />
	</screen>

	WARNING: Due to limitations in the parameter parsing the shift 
	colours MUST be specified as decimal numbers for all firmware 
	versions earlier than 4-Sep-2018.  For firmware builds later than 
	4-Sep-2018 the colours can be specified as decimal numbers, hex 
	numbers, Enigma2 "#" colour codes or colour names.  For example,

		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="#00ffffff,#00ffffff,#0000ffff,#00ff00ff" />
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyBoardShiftColors" value="White,White,Cyan,Magenta" />
		(Assuming the colours "White", "Cyan" and "Magenta" are defined!)

	IMPORTANT: Make sure that all the 1080 "vkey_*" images are copied to 
	the "/usr/share/enigma2/<skin>/buttons/" directory where "<skin>" is 
	the name of the skin that you are updating.

NOTE:
	The most important changes for a skin is to ensure that the width of 
	the "list" object is wide enough to display the larger keyboard.  The 
	width is calculated by multiplying number of buttons (14) by the 
	width of each button (in parameter "VirtualKeyBoard" and the actual 
	width of the button background or image. (720 skins 14 x 45 = 630, 
	1080 skins 14 x 68 = 952) 

	Also, the enhanced VirtualKeyBoard adds some new button images and 
	abandons others.  Graphic buttons for plain text are deprecated as 
	the new code creates these on the fly while allowing for language 
	localisation.

Removing legacy VirtualKeyBoard support:
	If support for the old VirtualKeyBoard code is not required for a 
	skin then the following items may be removed / deleted from the 
	skin:

	From the <fonts> block in the skin remove:
		<alias name="VirtualKeyboard" ... />
	
	From the <parameters> block in the skin remove:
		<parameter name="VirtualKeyboard" ... />

	IMPORTANT: The lower case "b" in "board" is significant!  The 
	"VirtualKeyboard" entries are used by the old code while 
	"VirtualKeyBoard" entries are used by the new code.

	From the buttons directory in the skin delete:
		vkey_all.png
		vkey_clr.png
		vkey_esc.png
		vkey_ok.png
		vkey_shift.png
		vkey_shift_sel.png
	Please do not delete any of these images if they are shared by other 
	skins that continue to support the older VirtualKeyBoard code.
